point: When you return a box its future results
will be automatically sent to the next handler.
If you add an onsend handler to that box here
that handler will also get executed BUT tits
reuslt will vanish in thin air unless you also
added  follower handlers to it.

You should not add handlers to the box you return
because system will do that for you. But the
system added handler will executed in a
parallel lane of its own you can not talk to
that in any way.

Point is in async you muts end in some final

typiocally be a single end point so you know
where to observe the creation of the side-effect
adn where to test it.

/**
 * nodeJsApiTest () shows how we can tame the Node.js
 * callbacks by putting them into boxes.
 *
 * We create a box with teo sequential handlers
 * box .onSend (getDirEnts, gotDirEnts);
 *
 * getDirEnts() returns a new box it creates
 * It then calls uses the node.js ASYNC api
 * fs.readdir() to get the names of all files
 * and dirs in the current directory. When the
 * callback happens that new box gets sent.
 * Because it was the result of getDirEnts()
 * it means the next handler gotDirEnts() gets
 * all the file and dirnames as argument.
 *
 * gotDirEnts() also creates a new box
 * to which it adds an onAddhandler which
 * counts how many values have been added
 * to it and when as many as there are file
 * and dir-names it calls send() on the box
 * that is returned by gotDirEnts().
 *
 * gotDirEnts()  adds an onSend() handler
 * to its result-box  which will call a final
 * handler gotAll() when ready which will
 * then get the  stats of all files and dirs
 * in the current directory.
 *
 * gotDirEnts() then calls terh Node.js async API
 * fs.lstat() with the absolute path of each file
 * and dir in the current directory. Because lstat()
 * is async we dont know when the result of each
 * call is ready so we use eachStateReady() as the
 * callback-argument to it.
 *
 * When eachStateReady  gets called it calls
 * statsBox.add ([stat, path]);  Note we must
 * have both the stat and path as part of the
 * data because the stat-datums returened by
 * Node do not know the filepath the file is
 * being referred to. There coudl be many
 * symbolic links referring to the same physical
 * file on disk after all.
 *
 * eachStateReady() calling add() means our
 * onAdd-handler fires for each stat. The
 * onHandler adds the [stat, path] as one
 * datum to the data of the box, and also
 * counts if we have all of them and when
 * we  do it calls send() of the box, meaning
 * the final handler gotAll() gets called with
 * all stats and their path. It creates a
 * single string telling the path and SIZE
 * of each file or dir and logs it for us
 * to show it all works.
 *
 * SO, this is quite complicated which is because
 * fs.readdir() and fs.lstat() are asynchronous
 * and we must call the lstat() for the whole
 * collection of file and dir names reurned by
 * readDir() and each such call then returns its
 * result async and we muts know when we have
 * all of them.
 *
 * It would be simpler had we used the synchronous
 * version of the APIs btu the point is to whose
 * that we can tame the async calls by putting them
 * into boxes. A similar thing has been done by
 * the Node.js current API by "promisifying" most (?)
 * of its async APIs. So this exammple showed that
 * we could do a similar thing with Boxes, in other
 * words in most cases Boxes can be used instead
 * of Promises, to make your code simpler to understand.
 *
 * How are Boxes simpler than Promises?
 *
 * They are simpler because you can create a
 * Box with a simple call to a pre-existing
 * constructor, then add send- and add- and
 * error-handlers to it as needed. Whereas with
 * Promises you must hand-code each promise-returning
 * constructor separately.
 * Try calling:
 *  let promise = new Promise();
 * and you will get error:
 * "Promise resolver undefined is not a function"
 *
 * So Promises don't really exemplify the
 * Object-Oriented concept of ENCAPSULATION:
 * You should be able to create a Promise without
 * knowing how it gets created,  then just use
 * it by calling its methods. You can not do
 * that with Promises but you can with Boxes.
